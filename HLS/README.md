# HLS flow

You can implement the task using HLS. 
We cann give you access to servers running Siemens Catapult HLS for the competition, or you can use any other AISC compatible HLS tool you have access to.

## Connecting to our server

## Scripting LLM and Catapult
*[example.py](https://github.com/gohil-vasudev/DAC-2024-GREAT-Workshop/blob/main/HLS/example.py)* works you through simple OpenAPI calls and running Catapult HLS from python. 

*[C2HLSC.py](https://github.com/gohil-vasudev/DAC-2024-GREAT-Workshop/blob/main/HLS/C2HLSC.py)* shows an example of a complete script that uses an LLM in the loop using feedback from catapult to go from generic C to synthesizable C. [Paper C2HLSC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09233)
