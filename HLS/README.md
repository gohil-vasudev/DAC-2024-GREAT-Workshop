We cann give you access to servers running Siemens Catapult HLS for the competition, or you can use any other AISC compatible HLS tool you have access to.

## Scripting LLM and Catapult
*[example.py](URL)* works you through simple OpenAPI calls and running Catapult HLS from python. 

*[C2HLSC.py](URL)* shows an example of a complete script that uses an LLM in the loop using feedback from catapult to go from generic C to synthesizable C. [Paper C2HLSC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09233)
